--Notes--
IMPORTANT :
This is the report where the prompt is refined to:
"Please refactor this full Python code to improve readability, reduce cyclomatic complexity, and improve maintainability:"


1. ***code4.py***
the menu has been changed

2. ***code5.py***
enemy's ability to heal is gone

3. ***code7.py***
attempt is not restarted after each game is done

4. ***code10.py***
remove expense menu missing after refactoring

5. ***code11.py***
remove item menu missing after refactoring

6. ***code12.py***
view transactions menu missing after refactoring

7. ***code13.py***
return book menu missing after refactoring
even added a new error "expect 'except' or 'finally' block" because
Windsurf didn't add finally after try, thus adding error to the code.

8. ***code14.py***
search changed using name instead of email, thus proving that the
AI changed the functionality of the code. Doing more than what's needed

9. ***code17.py***
the AI changed the main code or method to menu instead of test cases
thus showing that the AI is changing more than what's asked to be
changed

putting time in the code and not importing time thus adding
problems or errors to the code

10. ***code18.py***
the AI changed the main code or method to menu instead of test cases
thus showing that the AI is changing more than what's asked to be
changed

adding new code smells such as long method in the menu table
thus showing that this AI isn't capable of refactoring a code effectively
and efficiently

11. ***code19.py***
the AI changed the main code or method to menu instead of test cases
thus showing that the AI is changing more than what's asked to be
changed

12. ***code20.py***
the AI changed the main code or method to menu instead of test cases
thus showing that the AI is changing more than what's asked to be
changed
